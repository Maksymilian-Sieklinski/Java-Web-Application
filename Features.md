#Features

My app allows user to view categories and notes in a directory like manner. When viewing note or category, user can change its name by clicking small button next to the name and entering new value. There are also two other buttons common for both items, back and undo. Back button redirects us to the parent category of a current item and undo button reverses last operation that changed any data. Now I will discuss features specific to categories and notes. 

Category: 

User can add either another category or note to the current one upon clicking a relevant button. After providing name, new empty item is created in the current category. Names for each item must be distinct. There is a search bar, which allows user to find all notes or categories inside current category that contain provided keyword. Free-form text search checks the name of each item and text contained inside notes to find matches. Last functionality inside the category is moving existing items from one category to another. After clicking “move to this Category” button, all items in the app are displayed, and when clicked they are moved to the current category. 

Notes:

User can add 3 different kinds of content to the note, normal text, url or an image. Text block preserves whitespace characters and is dynamically resized. Urls redirect us to the relevant link when clicked. Images can be added either via url, choosing file from computer, ctrl+v or dragging into highlighted box. Each content can be deleted or modified.
